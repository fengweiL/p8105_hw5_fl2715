## Loading Library and Set Seed

``` r
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(1)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

## Problem 1

Firstly, we define a function.

``` r
birthday_sim=function(n){
  birthdays=sample(1:365, size=n, replace=TRUE)
  duplicate=length(birthdays)!= length((unique(birthdays)))
  return(duplicate)
}
```

And then, we run this function 10000 times for each group size between 2
and 50. And we create a tibble for the result.

``` r
num_simulations = 10000
group_sizes = 2:50
probabilities = numeric(length(group_sizes))

for (i in seq_along(group_sizes)) {
  n = group_sizes[i]
  duplicate_count = sum(replicate(num_simulations, birthday_sim(n)))
  probabilities[i] = duplicate_count / num_simulations
}

result=tibble(group_sizes, probabilities)
```

Next, we make a plot showing the probability Vs the different group
sizes.

``` r
ggplot(aes(x=group_sizes, y=probabilities), data=result) +
  geom_line()
```

**Comment**: From the above the plot, we can see that the probability
that at least two people share a birthday increases as the group size
increases. When the group size is 50, the probability of sharing
birthday is about 0.97, which is close to 1.
